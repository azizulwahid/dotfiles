# Azizul Wahid's dotfiles

My personal dotfiles for macOS and Linux, set up with
[dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) and inspiration from [Josiah
Nunemaker's blog
post](https://josnun.github.io/posts/managing-dotfiles-and-zsh-with-dotbot-and-antigen/).

## Setup

For macOS and most Linux, dotbot is set up to install the right packages. On
Alpine, they must be installed manually.

### macOS and Linux

```shell
git clone git@github.com:azizulwahid/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install
```
